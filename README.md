# decaprovs2018
A searchable version of DECA Provincials 2018 Results. Tweaked code from the <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/decaprovs2017/" target="_blank">2017 version</a> to fit the needs of 2018.
<br>
A PDF of the results was converted to CSV using Tabula, then converted to a JSON file online. The app allows users to specify search terms, which are used to filter and sort the data.
<br>
Created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.
<br>
The algorithms can probably be faster, but this was a one-day project. Some searches will be faster than others.
<br>
<br>
See the final version <a href="https://alan-ma.github.io/decaprovs2018/" target="_blank">here</a>.
